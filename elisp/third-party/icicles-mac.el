;;; Commentary: 
;; 
;;  This is a helper library for library `icicles.el'.  It defines
;;  macros.  See `icicles.el' for documentation.
;; 
;;  Macros defined here:
;;
;;    `icicle-define-command', `icicle-define-file-command'.
;; 
;;  Standard Emacs function defined here for older Emacs versions:
;;
;;    `select-frame-set-input-focus'.

;; 
;;; Change log:
;;
;; 2006/05/16 dadams
;;     icicle-define(-file)-command: Treat cases where user wiped out orig-buff or orig-window.
;; 2006/03/31 dadams
;;     icicle-define(-file)-command: Wrap action function in unwind-protect to select minibuf frame.
;; 2006/03/11 dadams
;;     icicle-define-file-command: Expand file in directory of icicle-last-input.
;; 2006/03/08 dadams
;;     icicle-define(-file)-command: Bug fix (thx to TobyCubitt):
;;       Make sure icicle-candidate-action-fn runs FUNCTION in original buffer and window.
;; 2006/03/07 dadams
;;     icicle-define(-file)-command: Mention in doc string that BINDINGS are not in effect
;;       within icicle-candidate-action-fn.

     prompt table &optional predicate require-match initial-input hist def inherit-input-method

  "Define COMMAND with DOC-STRING based on FUNCTION.
COMMAND is a symbol.  DOC-STRING is a string.
FUNCTION is a function that takes one argument, read as input.
  (If the argument to FUNCTION is a file name or directory name, then
  use macro `icicle-define-file-command', instead.)

BINDINGS is a list of `let*' bindings added around the command code.
  The following bindings are pre-included - you can refer to them in
  the command body (including in FIRST-SEXP, LAST-SEXP, UNDO-SEXP).

  `orig-buff'   is bound to (current-buffer)
  `orig-window' is bound to (selected-window)

In case of error or user quit, the original buffer is restored.

FIRST-SEXP is a sexp evaluated before the main body of the command.
UNDO-SEXP is a sexp evaluated in case of error or if the user quits.
LAST-SEXP is a sexp evaluated after the main body of the command.

Other arguments are as for `completing-read'.

In order, the created command does this:

 - Uses DOC-STRING, with information about Icicles bindings appended.
 - Binds BINDINGS for the rest of the command.
 - Evaluates FIRST-SEXP.
 - Reads input with `completing-read', using PROMPT, TABLE, PREDICATE,
   REQUIRE-MATCH, INITIAL-INPUT, HIST, DEF, and INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD.
 - Calls FUNCTION on the input that was read.
 - Evaluates UNDO-SEXP in case of error or if the user quits.
 - Evaluates LAST-SEXP.

The created command also binds `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to a
function that calls FUNCTION on the current completion candidate.
Note that BINDINGS are of course not in effect within
`icicle-candidate-action-fn'."
  `(defun ,command ()
    ,(concat doc-string "\n\nRead input, then "
             (and (symbolp function) (concat "call `" (symbol-name function) "' to "))
             "act on it.

Input-candidate completion and cycling are available.  While cycling,
these keys act on the current candidate:

\\<minibuffer-local-completion-map>\
`C-RET'   - Act on current completion candidate only
`C-next'  - Act, then move to next \
prefix-completion candidate
`C-prior' - Act, then move to previous \
prefix-completion candidate
`next'    - Act, then move to next \
apropos-completion candidate
`prior'   - Act, then move to previous \
apropos-completion candidate
`\\[icicle-all-candidates-action]'     - Act on *all* candidates, successively (careful!)

Use `RET' or `S-RET' to finally choose a candidate, or `C-g' to quit.
This is an Icicles command - see `icicle-mode'.")

  "Define COMMAND with DOC-STRING based on FUNCTION.
COMMAND is a symbol.  DOC-STRING is a string.
FUNCTION is a function that takes one file-name or directory-name
argument, read as input.  (Use macro `icicle-define-command' for a
FUNCTION whose argument is not a file or directory name.)

BINDINGS is a list of `let*' bindings added around the command code.
  The following bindings are pre-included - you can refer to them in
  the command body (including in FIRST-SEXP, LAST-SEXP, UNDO-SEXP).

  `orig-buff'   is bound to (current-buffer)
  `orig-window' is bound to (selected-window)

In case of error or user quit, the original buffer is restored.

FIRST-SEXP is a sexp evaluated before the main body of the command.
UNDO-SEXP is a sexp evaluated in case of error or if the user quits.
LAST-SEXP is a sexp evaluated after the main body of the command.

Other arguments are as for `read-file-name'.

In order, the created command does this:

 - Uses DOC-STRING, with information about Icicles bindings appended.
 - Binds BINDINGS for the rest of the command.
 - Evaluates FIRST-SEXP.
 - Reads input with `read-file-name', using PROMPT, DIR,
   DEFAULT-FILENAME, REQUIRE-MATCH, INITIAL-INPUT, and PREDICATE.
 - Calls FUNCTION on the input that was read.
 - Evaluates UNDO-SEXP in case of error or if the user quits.
 - Evaluates LAST-SEXP.

The created command also binds `icicle-candidate-action-fn' to a
function that calls FUNCTION on the current completion candidate.
Note that BINDINGS are of course not in effect within
`icicle-candidate-action-fn'."
  `(defun ,command ()
    ,(concat doc-string "\n\nRead input, then "
             (and (symbolp function) (concat "call `" (symbol-name function) "' to "))
             "act on it.

Input-candidate completion and cycling are available.  While cycling,
these keys act on the current candidate:

\\<minibuffer-local-completion-map>\
`C-RET'   - Act on current completion candidate only
`C-next'  - Act, then move to next \

apropos-completion candidate
`prior'   - Act, then move to previous \

`\\[icicle-all-candidates-action]'     - Act on *all* candidates, successively (careful!)

Use `RET' or `S-RET' to finally choose a candidate, or `C-g' to quit.
