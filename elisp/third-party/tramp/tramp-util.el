;;; Commentary:

;; Some misc. utility functions that might go nicely with Tramp.
;; Mostly, these are kluges awaiting real solutions later on.

;;; Code:

(require 'compile)
(require 'tramp)

(defun tramp-compile (command)
  "Compile on remote host."
  (interactive
   (if (or compilation-read-command current-prefix-arg)
       (list (read-from-minibuffer "Compile command: "
                                   compile-command nil nil
                                   '(compile-history . 1)))
     (list compile-command)))
  (setq compile-command command)
  (save-some-buffers (not compilation-ask-about-save) nil)
  (let ((d default-directory))
    (save-excursion
      (pop-to-buffer (get-buffer-create "*Compilation*") t)
      (erase-buffer)
      (setq default-directory d)))
  (tramp-handle-shell-command command (get-buffer "*Compilation*"))
  (pop-to-buffer (get-buffer "*Compilation*"))
