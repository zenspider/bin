;;; Usage

;; Enable window-numbering-mode and use M-1 through M-0 to navigate.
;;
;; If you want to affect the numbers, use window-numbering-before-hook or
;; window-numbering-assign-func.
;; For instance, to always assign the calculator window the number 9, add the
;; following to your .emacs:
;;
;; (setq window-numbering-assign-func
;;       '(lambda () (when (equal (buffer-name) "*Calculator*") 9)))


;;; Changes

;; 2007-02-18 (1.1)
;; added window-numbering-before-hook, window-numbering-assign-func
